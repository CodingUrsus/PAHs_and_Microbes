# Gut Microbiome, PAHs, and Impulsivity

## Overview

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a class of ubiquitous environmental pollutants, pose significant risks to human health, including cognitive function. PAHs enter the human body through various pathways, such as inhalation of polluted air and consumption of contaminated food, and are metabolized within the gut. The gut microbiome, has previously been linked to PAH exposure and numerous microorganisms are capable of metabolizing PAH compounds. Emerging evidence suggests that PAH exposure and alterations in gut microbial communities may intersect to influence impulsivity, a behavioral trait closely tied to cognitive health. This project investigates these complex interactions, using computational biology and multi-omic data integration to reveal novel insights into the PAH-related gut-brain-environment axis.

## Key Insights

Our analysis uncovers critical links between the gut microbiome, PAH exposure, and impulsivity. **PAH exposure**, visualized through a heatmap of scaled levels across participants, is unevenly distributed across the population. Individuals experience disproportionate exposure to PAHs, which may influence impulsivity or, conversely, may be influenced by it. This bidirectional relationship adds complexity to understanding the gut-brain axis.

We  observe that more impulsive subject display disproportionate PAH exposure levels. This connection, illustrated through a comparison of PAH abundance by impulsivity, reveals patterns that differ by sex, with males showing higher PAH exposure levels than females.

## Gut Microbiome and Impulsivity

Visualization (NMDS) ordination results and statistical testing of the taxonomic composition of the gut microbiome reveals  stratification of microbial communities based on impulsivity cohorts, suggesting a fundamental ecological shift within the gut which is related to impulsivity.

## Bridging the Connections

The interplay between PAH exposure, gut microbiota, and impulsivity culminates in a striking observation: microbes known to degrade PAHs are directly associated with PAH levels in the gut. These same taxa have previously been implicated in cognitive health, offering a plausible mechanistic pathway. Scatterplots mapping specific microbial taxa to PAH exposure further illustrate this connection, underscoring the role of gut microbes as mediators in the PAH-impulsivity relationship.

Together, these findings weave several disparate lines of investigation: environmental pollutants, microbial ecosystems, and impulsivity are intricately linked to one another. Available evidence points to numerous microbes which may be capable of degrading PAHs, and the degraded metabolic byproducts of PAHs are known to have sex-dependent effects on host physiology. Collectively, this work provides a fundamental set of links between the gut microbiome, PAHs and impulsivity, pointing to novel avenues for future research and potential therapeutic products and strategies.
